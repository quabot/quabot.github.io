# Getting Started

### Adding QuaBot to your server

Before you can use QuaBot, you need to add it to your server! You can do that with the following url: [invite.quabot.net](https://invite.quabot.net) or the direct [Discord Invite](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1410349992794787850&scope=bot%20applications.commands&permissions=395607272542&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fquabot.net%2Flogin%3Forigin%3D%2Fdashboard). You will see the following screen:

You can select the server you want to add QuaBot to with the server selector outlined above.

:::info Required Permissions
In order to add a bot to your server, you need either the **Manage Messages** or **Administrator** permissions.
:::

After selecting your server and clicking continue, you will see a full list of permissions you will grant QuaBot. QuaBot needs all of these (except for Administrator, but it prevents issues later on if the bot has admin - you can of course remove it since the bot can do everything with Administrator), so make sure it has them all. You then click Authorize, and the bot is in your server!

#### Logging in to the dashboard

You are then redirected, and prompted to authorize again. This is to login to the QuaBot dashboard. You will see a list of things the bot will be able to see. Click authorize again, and you will be logged in to the QuaBot Dashboard.

### Logging in to the QuaBot dashboard

If you added QuaBot with the guide above, you are already logged in. The dashboard keeps you logged in, and you do not have to log in again. If you are not logged in yet, you can do the following:

1. Go to https://quabot.net and click login in the top right.

2. Follow the authorization steps as outlined [above](#logging-in-to-the-dashboard).
3. You will see the server overview page. We will go into that page in more detail.

### Selecting a server

After you have logged in to the dashboard you will see the following page:
![ServerList](./img/GettingStarted-ServerList.png)

It might look different for you, with more or less servers but should be generally the same.

:::info Required Permissions
In order to configure a server you're in, you need either the **Manage Messages** or **Administrator** permissions.
:::

If your server does not show up, Reload the server list with button. (outlined in red below)
You can select the server you want to configure by clicking on it (as outlined in green below)
![ActionsServer List](./img/GettingStarted-ServerListActions.png)

If the bot is not in the server yet, you will now be redirected to the invite screen. Otherwise you will see the Dashboard. We will explain each item on this page in detail below.
