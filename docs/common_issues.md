# Common Issues

Some issues get asked quite often This page aims so explain the most common issues users have with QuaBot.

## Role not found!

That means that role QuaBot is trying to assign is invalid and could not be located. It has most likely been deleted and the configuration has not been updated. Ensure the role you are trying to give exists, by reconfiguring the role(s) and checking them all. If the issue persists, contact our team.

## Lacks permissions to assign or remove role (for user)

That means the bot misses some permissions. Ensure the [Permissions](./permissions.md) are setup correctly and the bot has the **Manage Roles** permission. Check that the [QuaBot Role Position](./permissions.md#quabot-role-position) has been configured correctly. **If the role position is not configured correctly, QuaBot cannot assign this role to users. Read through the Role Position section to ensure you have configured it correctly.** If the issue persists, contact our team.

## Do you need additional support?

Most commands should have either of these two ways to manage permissions, but some commands might only have one of them. If you have any questions or need help, feel free to reach out to our [support server](https://discord.quabot.net). We're here to help you get the most out of QuaBot!
