# Common Issues

Having issues with QuaBot? These are common issues that users have and that show up on the issues page frequently.

## Roles

### Role not found!

That means that role QuaBot is trying to assign is invalid and could not be located. It has most likely been deleted and the configuration has not been updated. Ensure the role you are trying to give exists, by reconfiguring the role(s) and checking them all. If the issue persists, [contact us](#do-you-need-additional-support).

### Lacks permissions to assign or remove role (for user)

That means the bot misses some permissions. Ensure the [Permissions](./permissions.md) are setup correctly and the bot has the **Manage Roles** permission. Check that the [QuaBot Role Position](./permissions.md#quabot-role-position) has been configured correctly. **If the role position is not configured correctly, QuaBot cannot assign this role to users. Read through the Role Position section to ensure you have configured it correctly.** If the issue persists, [contact us](#do-you-need-additional-support).

## Channels

### Channel not found!

That means the channel QuaBot is trying to find and send a message in, is invalid and could not be located. It has most likely been deleted and the configuration has not been updated since. Ensure the channel exists and reconfigure the channel. You can also create a new one. If the issue persists, [contact us](#do-you-need-additional-support).

### Lacks permissions to send messages in channel

That means the bot misses some permissions for that channel. Ensure the [Permissions](./permissions.md) are setup correctly and the bot has the **Send Messages** permission in that channel or category through any of it's roles. More information about Discord Permissions can be found in [Discord's official FAQ here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206029707-Setting-Up-Permissions-FAQ). If the issue persists, [contact us](#do-you-need-additional-support).

## Do you need additional support?

Most commands should have either of these two ways to manage permissions, but some commands might only have one of them. If you have any questions or need help, feel free to reach out to our [support server](https://discord.quabot.net). We're here to help you get the most out of QuaBot!
