QuaBot Premium is an optional upgrade that enhances your server with powerful customization options, increased limits, and premium‑only features — all while directly supporting the continued development and hosting of QuaBot. Premium is now purchased directly through Discord’s built‑in payment system, making subscribing simple and secure.

## Why go Premium?

QuaBot Premium unlocks various features and customization options for your server — including removing QuaBot branding, increasing module limits, advanced moderation functionality, and early access to new features.

Premium not only upgrades your server, but also supports ongoing development, hosting, and improvements for all users.
