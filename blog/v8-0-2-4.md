- Various crashes fixed and bug fixes applied.
- Overhauled the servers page and the authorization flow. Servers now show Invite or Manage based on if the bot is in the server. If you invited the bot using the server list before the entire system would stop working preventing you from configuring your server. This has been resolved.
